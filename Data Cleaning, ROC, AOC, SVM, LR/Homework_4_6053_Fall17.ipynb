One of the drivers of the performance of a model is the sample size of the training set.  As a data scientist, sometimes you have to decide if you have enough data or if you should invest in more.  We can use learning curve analysis to determine if we have reached a performance plateau. This will inform us on whether or not we should invest in more data (in this case it would be by running more experiments).\n",

In bootstrap analysis, we pull multiple samples of size $N_i$, build a model, evaluate on a test set, and then take an average and standard error of the results.\n",
